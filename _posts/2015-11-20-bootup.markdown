Ever wanted to see an alternative to Kickstarter or Indiegogo? Well, that's what BootUp is for...

{% include image.html url="/assets/bootup/home.png" description="BootUp homepage" location="left" %}

I created BootUp as fulfillment for an assessment as part of the third year module Interactive Application Programming Techniques at the University of York. The focus of the assessment was creating a usable and accessible website that matched a set of requirements we were given.

The design and implementation was done solely by myself. With regards to the design, we had to use user-centred design principles.

More information and instructions on how to try BootUp yourself can be found on the [repo website](http://terminalstar.github.io/BootupFinal/).

BootUp was built with [web2py](http://web2py.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).
